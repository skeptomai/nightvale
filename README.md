# nightvale

My family and I are all big fans of the podcast "Welcome to Night Vale".  Before a recent family trip to the UK, I decided to download all the episodes for us to enjoy on the flight.  I figured out that I could get the podcast website to list all episodes and descriptions in one page, which I could then scrape, parse and download via the links.

As an exercise, I've been rewriting the downloader in several languages, including Ruby, Go and now Java.  I'm by no means a Java expert, having last written production Java code about 8 years ago.  The code in this repo is reflective of my (re)learning process.  It has egregious use of recent features just so I can try them out.  It's only here for me to goof with. Caveat Emptor.
